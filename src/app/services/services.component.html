        We use <span class="highlight">USDA pigs</span> obtained from wholesale suppliers, ranging in size from about 60
        pounds to 120 pounds. The general rule is one pound of pork per person, and so, for example, if you have 100
        guests, you order a 100-pound pig for your event.
        <br><br>
        We tailor your pig roasting service around your eventâ€™s needs and specification giving you and your guests the
        best pig roasting catering experience. Whether you are having a wedding reception, birthday party, business
        gathering or any large celebration, a pig roast is easy and fun for any occasion!
